Dotfiles
========

This repository contains all my important dotfiles.
I manage it with [GNU Stow][2], as outlined by [xero][1] and [Kraymer][3].

Install
-------

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install stow
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/axblount/dotfiles
$ cd dotfiles
$ ./util.sh install # this installs all packages
```
